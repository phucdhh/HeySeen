## Summary of Differences

### Accuracy
- The original TeX file is a well-structured academic paper using amsart class with proper LaTeX formatting.
- The HeySeen output contains significant OCR errors, including incorrect markup like `<math display="block">` instead of proper LaTeX math environments.
- Math expressions are not properly converted to LaTeX syntax; instead, they appear as malformed HTML-like tags or escaped text.
- Text recognition has errors, such as "MAURÍCIO CORRÊA, GILCIONE NONATO COSTA," being split into sections incorrectly.

### Layout
- Original: Proper document structure with title, author, abstract, sections, theorems, etc.
- Generated: Uses basic article class, incorrect sectioning (e.g., sections for author names), and page breaks with \newpage.
- The layout does not preserve the original's formatting, such as theorem environments or proper spacing.

### Math Rendering
- Original: Extensive use of proper LaTeX math, including operators, symbols, and complex equations.
- Generated: Math is poorly recognized; equations are represented as text with backslashes and incorrect syntax, e.g., `\textbackslash\{\}lim\_\{t \textbackslash\{\}to 0\}` instead of `\lim_{t \to 0}`.

## Specific Issues Found
1. **Markup Errors**: Use of `<math>` tags and `\textbackslash` instead of standard LaTeX.
2. **Text Splitting**: Author names and titles are incorrectly placed in separate sections.
3. **Math OCR Failure**: Equations are not converted to LaTeX; remain as text or malformed.
4. **Structure Loss**: Loss of theorem, lemma, and other environments; replaced with basic text.
5. **Encoding Issues**: Special characters like accents are handled inconsistently.

## Suggestions for Improvements
1. **Enhance Math OCR**: Improve the Texify integration to properly convert detected math regions to LaTeX.
2. **Fix Markup Generation**: Ensure the TeX builder produces valid LaTeX without HTML-like tags.
3. **Better Layout Analysis**: Preserve document structure, such as recognizing titles, abstracts, and sections properly.
4. **Error Correction**: Implement post-processing to correct common OCR errors in text and math.
5. **Testing with Math-Heavy Documents**: Use more examples like this to refine the system for academic papers.
